# **mysterious**

As a means of learning to code, I am hereby sharing my first program to the world: An adaptation of the one built in CodeCademy's "mysterious organism" project. I like this mini project so I am continuously tweaking it in order to apply new syntax and approaches. (Upcoming tweaks can be seen in to-do.txt)

##### **version:** notReady | **tech:** JS ES6 - '15 + node.js | **status:** ongoing (see to-do.txt)

## **usage**
This program emulates an *extremely simplified*, imaginary tool for working with genes. It allows the user to create short DNA/RNA strands, mutate them, compare them and evaluate them, and to record all data produced (but only for a given session).

This program is meant to be used directly in the terminal, through node.js. More information on instalation and functionalities coming soon.

## **legal & admin**
This program is an adaptation of that in Codecademy's "mysterious organism" project. All legal rights, if any, belong to CodeCademy.
To keep it safe, let's assume anybody can use this adapted code for any non-commercial purposes.
