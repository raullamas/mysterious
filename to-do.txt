UI
[X] Chooses either DNA or RNA
[ ] Updates onRecord parameters before anything else
[ ] Does not swift from one nucleic acid to another for the rest of a given project
[ ] Gets/sets specimens with IDs starting on 1 (0 is unorthodox)
[ ] Does not see supporting methods on onRecord
[ ] Sees explanation of errors - e.g. Pool of specimens can't exceed 4 * strand length
[ ] Does not input non-integer or NaN values in some Fns
[ ] Gets ID set to minimum number available from pool if she creates specimen without defining ID (avoids messiness of IDs in the millions)
[ ] Inputs data in either uppercase or lowercase letters
[ ] [#x]: Gets back all resulting errors at once if she passes invalid inputs (able to fix all errors in one go) (see #y)
[ ] Sees all objects on record as { ID, strand } pairs sorted Re: ID
[ ] Passes either 1 array of objects or multiple objects to findMostRelated()
[ ] Processess all specimens on record if she inputs no argument when trying to findMostRelated()
    (Hint: Object.create from onRecord, and use getter to iterate on prototype to get array of objects)
    (Hint: Alternatively, update onRecord to list array of objects rather than Sets (for IDs and strands) - may not be visible in CLI)
    (Note: With latter, we'd get rid of tracking separately Set of IDs and Set of strands)

PRACTICE
[ ] Use setters, getters and/or _ convention
[ ] Make errors object more concise - e.g. use this. to reduce lines of code and/or separate errors from explanations
[ ] Account for DNA strands exceeding SAFE_INTEGER (safe length = 15?)
[ ] Experiment w/ location and type of variables and functions to see whether anything breaks (e.g. const vs var)
[ ] Outsource gate if statements
[ ] Replace errors.duplicateID( ), errors.duplicateDNASeq( ) w/ non-method properties that use this.?
[ ] Fix: onRecord.iDs.has(specimId): RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded if calling more than 300
[ ] Directly create sturdy specimens when trying to getNRandSturdy() (avoid inefficient creation and deletion of non-sturdy)
[ ] Eliminate all side effects - e.g. newSpecim() adding data to onRecord besides returning object
[ ] Refactor mutate using reducer
[ ] Check whether properties must be managed dinamically, as in invalidNumRandSturdy()
[ ] Improve variable names: coreMethods() be 'approved methods'; compareDna() be 'compare'
[ ] Shorten exec code of newSpecim: Use a helper inner function
[ ] [#y]: Fix: newSpecim: if specimens pool is filled, it returns "specim ID must be a number between ..." before "pool is filled" (see #x)
[ ] Fix: if onRecord is initialized with Error, accessing properties of onRecord returns undefined
[ ] Remove circular dependency between onRecord and errors objects
