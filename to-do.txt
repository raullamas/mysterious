FEAT
[X] Chooses either DNA or RNA
[X] Gets/sets specimens with IDs starting on 1 (0 is unorthodox)
[X] Gets IDs with uniform number of characters
[X] Inputs strings in uppercase or lowercase, with or without whitespace
[ ] Does not see supporting methods on settings
    (Hint: Non-enumerable 'state' object inside settings)
[ ] Updates settings before anything else
[ ] Does not swift from one nucleic acid to another for the rest of a given project
[ ] Sees explanation of errors - e.g. Pool of specimens can't exceed 4 * strand length
[ ] Gets ID set to minimum number available from pool if she creates specimen without defining ID (avoids messiness of IDs in the millions)
[ ] Gets back all resulting errors at once if she passes invalid inputs (able to fix all errors in one go)
[ ] Sees all objects on record as { ID, strand } pairs sorted Re: ID
[ ] Passes either 1 array of objects or multiple objects to findMostRelated()
[ ] Processess all specimens on record if she inputs no argument when trying to findMostRelated()
    (Hint: Object.create from settings, and use getter to iterate on prototype to get array of objects)
    (Hint: Alternatively, update settings to list array of objects rather than Sets (for IDs and strands) - may not be visible in CLI)
    (Note: With latter, we'd get rid of tracking separately Set of IDs and Set of strands)
[ ] Passes a number (as a string) ending in decimal point (w/out trailing zeros)
[ ] Trim in between whitespace
[ ] Add % to relatedness fns

FIX
[X] Have user fns take nums in string format | (To avoid undesired base conversion if leading 0s).
[X] Fix findMostRelated failing if passed sparse array
[ ] Add "status not modified if error" functionality to getErrors.
    (I.e. if calling newSpecim inside findMostRelated directly returns an error, prevent newSpecim from being recorded...)
    (... and let user know)
    Fix errors methods from returning nonsensical values when passed undefined or invalid arguments
[ ] Calling newSpecim() with invalid args inside calling of findMostRelated() warns user of outer error but not of inner error (that of newSpecim() failing to return valid specim). Possibly same situation for compare()
[ ] Calling higher tier functions with Error return values from lower tier functions results in misleading messages or omitted information
[ ] Fix: if randID() (and randStrand()?) returns undefined (due to pool being full), calling newSpecim() returns 'Pass a string' rather than 'pool blown'
[ ] Disallow passing null in some Fns
[ ] Disallow pasing NaN in some Fns
[ ] Fix: attempting to create more sturdy than strand length permits results in infinite loop
    (Hint: insert in getNRandSturdy: while loop: else: console.log('[del]', 'ID: '+ randSpecim.ID, ', strand: ' + randSpecim.strand))
[ ] Account for DNA strands exceeding SAFE_INTEGER (safe length = 15?)
[ ] Fix: settings.iDs.has(specimId): RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded if calling more than 300
[ ] Fix: if settings is initialized with Error, accessing properties of settings returns undefined & calling newSpecim can break code
[ ] Remove circular dependency between settings and errors objects
    (getErrors(): invalidAcid: 'Nucleic acid must be either \'DNA\' or \'RNA\'.')
    (getErrors(): invalidLength: 'Strand length must be a numeric value between 2 and 15 (inclusive)')
    (getsettings(): if (nucAcid..), return 'Error: ' + errors.invalidAcid)
    (getsettings(): else if (typeof strandLength..), return 'Error: ' + errors.invalidLength)
    (Hint: Is this related to #z?)

REFACTOR
[X] Use more descriptive variable & method names. Tweak findMostRelated() to make it easier to read
[X] getSettings() & newSpecim() inner-call trim() & toUpperCase() only once rather than multiple times
[X] Refine newSpecim() error logic | Check only num of IDs on file to confirm pool is full: Improve perf. * Specimens MUST have 1 ID and 1 strand *.
[X] Keep getErrors() dry | Convert properties into generic methods w/ parameters: To declutter.
[X] Refine error logic in user fns | Rearrange error statements and group by parameter: Improve perf & U interaction.
[X] Have user fns take only valid nums if taking nums | Stop fns from taking empty, negative and non-integer num strings: Improve U interaction.
[X] Errors object's code is messy and its methods return wordy, unformatted messages.
[ ] what about negative inputs? Also: separate negative input from invalidNumber: Different logic.
[ ] 1 and other numerals in newSpecim() (and possibly in other fns) belong in settings object
[ ] Use setters, getters and/or _ convention
[ ] Experiment w/ location and type of variables and fns to see whether anything breaks (e.g. const vs var)
[ ] Make errors object more concise - e.g. use this. to reduce lines of code and/or separate errors from explanations
[ ] [#z]: Replace errors.duplicateID( ), errors.duplicateStrand( ) w/ non-method properties that use this.?
[ ] Directly create sturdy specimens when trying to getNRandSturdy() (avoid inefficient creation and deletion of non-sturdy: hint: pushSturdy())
[ ] Eliminate all side effects - e.g. newSpecim() adding data to settings besides returning object
[ ] Refactor all other fns to use .reduce
[ ] Check whether properties must be managed dinamically, as in invalidNumRandSturdy()
[ ] Shorten exec code of newSpecim: Use a helper inner fn
[ ] Re-check that variable & method names are easy to follow
    (e.g.: isInvalidNum -> isNotNum)
