UI
[X] Chooses either DNA or RNA
[ ] Updates settings before anything else
[ ] Does not swift from one nucleic acid to another for the rest of a given project
[X] Gets/sets specimens with IDs starting on 1 (0 is unorthodox)
[ ] Does not see supporting methods on settings
    (Hint: Non-enumerable 'state' object inside settings)
[ ] Sees explanation of errors - e.g. Pool of specimens can't exceed 4 * strand length
[ ] Gets ID set to minimum number available from pool if she creates specimen without defining ID (avoids messiness of IDs in the millions)
[X] Gets IDs with uniform number of characters
[ ] Sets IDs w/ any number of leading zeros (instead of none)
[ ] Does not input non-integer or NaN values in some Fns
[X] Inputs strings in uppercase or lowercase, with or without whitespace.
[ ] [#x]: Gets back all resulting errors at once if she passes invalid inputs (able to fix all errors in one go) (see #y)
[ ] Sees all objects on record as { ID, strand } pairs sorted Re: ID
[ ] Passes either 1 array of objects or multiple objects to findMostRelated()
[ ] Processess all specimens on record if she inputs no argument when trying to findMostRelated()
    (Hint: Object.create from settings, and use getter to iterate on prototype to get array of objects)
    (Hint: Alternatively, update settings to list array of objects rather than Sets (for IDs and strands) - may not be visible in CLI)
    (Note: With latter, we'd get rid of tracking separately Set of IDs and Set of strands)

PRACTICE
[ ] Fix: attempting to create more sturdy than strand length permits results in infinite loop
    (Hint: insert in getNRandSturdy: while loop: else: console.log('[del]', 'ID: '+ randSpecim.ID, ', strand: ' + randSpecim.strand))
[ ] Use setters, getters and/or _ convention
[ ] Make errors object more concise - e.g. use this. to reduce lines of code and/or separate errors from explanations
[ ] Account for DNA strands exceeding SAFE_INTEGER (safe length = 15?)
[ ] Experiment w/ location and type of variables and functions to see whether anything breaks (e.g. const vs var)
[ ] Outsource gate if statements
[ ] [#z]: Replace errors.duplicateID( ), errors.duplicateStrand( ) w/ non-method properties that use this.?
[ ] Fix: settings.iDs.has(specimId): RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded if calling more than 300
[ ] Directly create sturdy specimens when trying to getNRandSturdy() (avoid inefficient creation and deletion of non-sturdy)
[ ] Eliminate all side effects - e.g. newSpecim() adding data to settings besides returning object
[ ] Refactor mutate using reducer
[ ] Check whether properties must be managed dinamically, as in invalidNumRandSturdy()
[X] Use more descriptive variable & method names. Tweak findMostRelated() to make it easier to read.
[ ] Shorten exec code of newSpecim: Use a helper inner function
[ ] Optimize: getSettings() & newSpecim() inner-call trim() & toUpperCase() only once rather than multiple times
[ ] [#y]: Fix: newSpecim: if specimens pool is filled, it returns "specim ID must be a number between ..." before "pool is filled" (see #x)
[ ] Fix: if settings is initialized with Error, accessing properties of settings returns undefined
[ ] Remove circular dependency between settings and errors objects
    (getErrors(): invalidAcid: 'Nucleic acid must be either \'DNA\' or \'RNA\'.')
    (getErrors(): invalidLength: 'Strand length must be a numeric value between 2 and 15 (inclusive)')
    (getsettings(): if (nucAcid..), return 'Error: ' + errors.invalidAcid)
    (getsettings(): else if (typeof strandLength..), return 'Error: ' + errors.invalidLength)
    (Hint: Is this related to #z?)
